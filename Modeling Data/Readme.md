The project aims to create datasets for modeling insurance rates across California for Auto, Home, and Landlord products. These datasets are utilized extensively by the Actuarial department in various other projects.

Thorough exploration of the source transactional system (SPInn) was conducted to retrieve historical data, focusing on mid-term changes. SCD Type 2 dimensions for risk items (DIM_VEHICLE, DIM_DRIVER, DIM_BUILDING) were created specifically for this project initially, and then, have been consistently leveraged across multiple projects.

The dataset granularity operates at the policy mid-term level, capturing any alterations that could impact the risk assessment of a policy. This dataset offers a depth of complexity, featuring intricate measures derived from analytical functions, capping mechanisms, and sophisticated policy and claims data linkage, providing insights beyond the conventional 6- or 12-month periods found in other datasets.
