50+ very complex calculations based on analysis transactional data, analytical function, different levels of aggregation and sophisticated capping rules. The calculation is performed in Redshift stored procedures, views and Tableau dashboards.

The previous version was calculated manually in Excel and it took 1 week.

The project outputs are tables and views available for ad-hoc reporting and Tableau dashboards.
