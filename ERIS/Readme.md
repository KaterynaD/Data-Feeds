**Enterprise Rate Indication System (ERIS)** provides access to historical data in specific format from different transactional systems in one view. The previous version pulled data everfy 6 months using a SAS code written in 2014 with the knowledge of CSE data from 2014. This code was slow and had  issues. The new process was designed to be run daily automatically and output consistent data with other data feeds and dashboards, used in the company.

_The technical challenges of the project include combining data from three different transactional systems using cumbersome categories coding, implementing several levels of data aggregations, and applying capping. The part I like is **cumulative multiplication** applied in one metric._
